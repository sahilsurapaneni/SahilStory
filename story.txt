Once upon a time there was a 16 year old teenager named Johnny whose dream it was to become an NBA player. 
Johnny had been playing basketball for his whole life and was extremely talented yet no one gave him a chance to play
becuase he was only 5'6''. Then one day when Johnny was walking to school everything changed. Lebron James approached him on the street invited him to play basketball. Everyone on the street was so impressed. Suddenly he was getting lots of attention at school, especially from the basketball players and coaches.
